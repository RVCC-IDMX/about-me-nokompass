This project was created as part of the IDMX Web Design and Development class at Raritan Valley Community College.
I already knew quite a bit about HTML and CSS before starting this class, but I ended up learning more than I previously knew.
The big thing I learned was media states. I also learned about hover effects and general good website design practices.

There was no set color scheme for this website.
Instead of using colors to draw the user's attention, I used darkened image backgrounds, blurred elements using backldrop filters with drop shadows, and highlight text/images.
This lead to really good accessibility. So good in fact, that I barely had to make any changes to text color or images while developing this website.
