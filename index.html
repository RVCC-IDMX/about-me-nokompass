      <h2>An Excerpt From The Life of Samuel Johnson</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Johnson said, that Dr. Grainger was an agreeable man; a man who
          would do any good that was in his power. His translation of
          Tibullus, he thought, was very well done; but The Sugar-Cane, a
          poem, did not please him; for, he exclaimed, 'What could he make of
          a sugar-cane? One might as well write the "Parsley-bed, a Poem;" or
          "The Cabbage-garden, a Poem."' BOSWELL. 'You must then pickle your
          cabbage with the sal atticum.' JOHNSON. 'You know there is already
          The Hop-Garden, a Poem: and, I think, one could say a great deal
          about cabbage. The poem might begin with the advantages of civilized
          society over a rude state, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no
          cabbages till Oliver Cromwell's soldiers introduced them; and one
          might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest, as they were by
          the Roman arms.' He seemed to be much diverted with the fertility of
          his own fancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I told him, that I heard Dr. Percy was writing the history of the
          wolf in Great-Britain. JOHNSON. 'The wolf, Sir! why the wolf? why
          does he not write of the bear, which we had formerly? Nay, it is
          said we had the beaver. Or why does he not write of the grey rat,
          the Hanover rat, as it is called, because it is said to have come
          into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came? I
          should like to see The History of the Grey Rat, by Thomas Percy, D.
          D., Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majesty,' (laughing immoderately).
          BOSWELL. 'I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of
          the grey rat.' JOHNSON. 'Sir, he need not give it the name of the
          Hanover rat.' Thus could he indulge a luxuriant sportive
          imagination, when talking of a friend whom he loved and esteemed.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Friday, March 22, having set out early from Henley, where we had
          lain the preceding night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine
          o'clock, and, after breakfast, went to call on his old schoolfellow
          Mr. Hector. A very stupid maid, who opened the door, told us, that
          'her master was gone out; he was gone to the country; she could not
          tell when he would return.' In short, she gave us a miserable
          reception; and Johnson observed, 'She would have behaved no better
          to people who wanted him in the way of his profession.' He said to
          her, 'My name is Johnson; tell him I called. Will you remember the
          name?' She answered with rustick simplicity, in the Warwickshire
          pronunciation, 'I don't understand you, Sir.'--'Blockhead, (said
          he,) I'll write.' I never heard the word blockhead applied to a
          woman before, though I do not see why it should not, when there is
          evident occasion for it. He, however, made another attempt to make
          her understand him, and roared loud in her ear, 'Johnson,' and then
          she catched the sound.
