        <h2>An Excerpt From The Life of Samuel Johnson</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Johnson said, that Dr. Grainger was an agreeable man; a man who
            would do any good that was in his power. His translation of
            Tibullus, he thought, was very well done; but The Sugar-Cane, a
            poem, did not please him; for, he exclaimed, 'What could he make of
            a sugar-cane? One might as well write the "Parsley-bed, a Poem;" or
            "The Cabbage-garden, a Poem."' BOSWELL. 'You must then pickle your
            cabbage with the sal atticum.' JOHNSON. 'You know there is already
            The Hop-Garden, a Poem: and, I think, one could say a great deal
            about cabbage. The poem might begin with the advantages of civilized
            society over a rude state, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no
            cabbages till Oliver Cromwell's soldiers introduced them; and one
            might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest, as they were by
            the Roman arms.' He seemed to be much diverted with the fertility of
            his own fancy.
          </p>

          <p>
            I told him, that I heard Dr. Percy was writing the history of the
            wolf in Great-Britain. JOHNSON. 'The wolf, Sir! why the wolf? why
            does he not write of the bear, which we had formerly? Nay, it is
            said we had the beaver. Or why does he not write of the grey rat,
            the Hanover rat, as it is called, because it is said to have come
            into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came? I
            should like to see The History of the Grey Rat, by Thomas Percy, D.
            D., Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majesty,' (laughing immoderately).
            BOSWELL. 'I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of
            the grey rat.' JOHNSON. 'Sir, he need not give it the name of the
            Hanover rat.' Thus could he indulge a luxuriant sportive
            imagination, when talking of a friend whom he loved and esteemed.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Friday, March 22, having set out early from Henley, where we had
            lain the preceding night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine
            o'clock, and, after breakfast, went to call on his old schoolfellow
            Mr. Hector. A very stupid maid, who opened the door, told us, that
            'her master was gone out; he was gone to the country; she could not
            tell when he would return.' In short, she gave us a miserable
            reception; and Johnson observed, 'She would have behaved no better
            to people who wanted him in the way of his profession.' He said to
            her, 'My name is Johnson; tell him I called. Will you remember the
            name?' She answered with rustick simplicity, in the Warwickshire
            pronunciation, 'I don't understand you, Sir.'--'Blockhead, (said
            he,) I'll write.' I never heard the word blockhead applied to a
            woman before, though I do not see why it should not, when there is
            evident occasion for it. He, however, made another attempt to make
            her understand him, and roared loud in her ear, 'Johnson,' and then
            she catched the sound.
